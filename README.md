# Building Decentralized AI

December 9th 2023 the Decentralized AI community assembled from around the world in Austin, TX in order to begin contributing to this repository.

The objectives are to define both the tech stack and the practical technical standards for collaboration between everyone in the community.

Morpheus both encourages and will incentive developers who propose or implement new standards or integrations between open source projects in DeAI.
